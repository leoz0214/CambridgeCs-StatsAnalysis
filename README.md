# Cambridge Computer Science - Stats Analysis

Undergraduate Computer Science at Cambridge is a very competitive university course, entailing both a top university and popular subject. Applicants tend to require outstanding grades and achievements, but even this not enough sometimes, as the field of competition consists of the best of the best. The offer rate of <10%, even lower than similar Cambridge courses, reflects the popularity yet limited spaces.

There is a document online that contains interesting data on applications and their degree success (original college offer, other college offer, winter pool), providing key insight into the effect of the following on success:
- A-Level predicted grades
- Number of 9s at GCSE
- TMUA score

The data was obtained from a Freedom of Information request, and can be found here: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/computer_science_admissions_stat_68

This project aims to carefully extract the data from the PDF, store it in a database, and proceed to process the data and output some key statistics.

A reality check is always nice - it is good to consider whether a given combination of predicted grades stands a chance, alongside how TMUA score affects chances, for example.
